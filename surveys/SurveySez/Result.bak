/**
 * Result.php provides additional data access classes for the SurveySez project
 * 
 * This file requires Response.php to access the Response & Choice classes
 *
 * This file requires Survey.php to access the original Survey, Question & Answer classes
 * 
 * Data access for several of the SurveySez pages are handled via Survey classes 
 * named Survey,Question & Answer, respectively.  These classes model the one to many 
 * relationships between their namesake database tables. 
 *
 * Version 5 refactors the Result object and adds the showGraph() method to the 
 * Result class, to present a bar graph when showing results 
 *
 * Version 4 adds the capability to create a 'form' for taking a survey.  It also 
 * changes the question object to store the 'InputType', for example, 'radio'
 *
 * Version 3 introduces two new classes, the Result and Tally classes, and moderate 
 * changes to the existing classes, Survey, Question & Answer.  The Result class will 
 * inherit from the Survey Class (using the PHP extends syntax) and will be an elaboration 
 * on a theme.
  *
 * Version 2 introduces two new classes, the Response and Choice classes, and moderate 
 * changes to the existing classes, Survey, Question & Answer.  The Response class will 
 * inherit from the Survey Class (using the PHP extends syntax) and will be an elaboration 
 * on a theme.  
 *
 * An instance of the Response class will attempt to identify a SurveyID from the " . PREFIX . "responses 
 * database table, and if it exists, will attempt to create all associated Survey, Question & Answer 
 * objects, nearly exactly as the Survey object.
